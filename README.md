# Todo List React

[Live preview](https://shubsmastan-todo-list-react.netlify.app/).

## Description

This is an app created using React.js which allows the user to input Todo tasks, mark them as done and delete them. It was an assignment created as part of the full-stack JavaScript pathway on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

## How It Was Made

- Initialised a React.js app using Webpack and Babel [dev dependencies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3LpsM42s5o).
- It was incredibly helpful to learn more about how to use Webpack and other modules from scratch instead of relying on "create-react-app".
- Used JSX to create components and deploy to them to the app (the focus on this part was to learn JSX, state and hooks).
- React documentation was updated at time of creation: made sure to focus on the most up-to-date React methods and using functional components instead of class components.
- Used a sensible Git workflow (regular commits and squashing when reaching milestones in production).
